uuidtime is a Linux and Windows terminal program to generate an UUID(like)
serial number of current time based on seconds and microseconds since epoch(1970).
I started this project when I realized I couldn't sort many UUID from 'uuidgen -t'.
The real UUIDs use multiple factors to assure unicity of the id, but uuidtime only
relies on microseconds precision and 3 random bytes to ensure it can generate an 
acceptable unique id. So to resume there are greater chances to hit a 
collision with this program than with uuidgen.

You can compile the source code by running 'make' in the source directory.
There is no install mechanism, just copy the resulting executable wherever
you see fit, ie. to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /opt/bin.

user@hostname$ ./uuidtime
07e70919-0000-6538-8335-000cd2cf45cb

user@hostname$ for i in `seq 1 4`; do ./uuidtime; done
